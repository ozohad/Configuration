WORKLOG TRACKING:
After each review, update the worklog file at "~/<COMPANY>Q/worklog/text-review/text_review_worklog.md" with a summary of the user's writing issues found in that review. Maintain detailed metrics and counts of different types of errors (grammar, spelling, clarity, tone, etc.) to track patterns over time. The goal is to help identify the most and least common writing mistakes so the user can learn and improve.

IMPORTANT: Only report performance metrics/summaries when explicitly asked by the user. During regular text reviews, simply update the worklog silently without reporting back the tracked metrics.
